Please see priority backlog for indepth documentation on features that are
unimplemented as of 4/15/2016.



Broad overview of key features in progress:

1. Zombie mobility. At the end of next sprint, the zombies will track 
and attack the hero instead of remaining stationary.

2. Map update. Will include areas that are unreachable by the hero to improve
user experience and allow for a higher difficulty and the need for strategy.

3. Map visual update. Currently the soccer field map is a placeholder. When completed
the map will reflect a more appropriate setting one would expect from a zombie survival
shooter.

4. Sprite update. Same as above, the sprites being presented at this time are placeholders
to be updated and replaced to improve user experience.

5. Timer implementation. At this time, beating the game is impossible, as there is no timer.
The object of the game is to outlive the timer. The next sprint will include this feature.
